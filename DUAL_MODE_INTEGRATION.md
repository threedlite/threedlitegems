# Dual Mode Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated two display modes into the ThreeDLite Live Wallpaper:
- **Classic Mode**: Traditional 9 polyhedra (tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, etc.)
- **Gems Mode**: 142 complex polyhedra loaded from data files

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Abstract Base Class
- Created `AbstractThreeDWallpaper` for shared functionality
- Both renderers extend this abstract class

### 2. Renderer Classes
- `ThreeDLiteClassicWallpaper`: Displays 9 predefined stock objects
- `ThreeDLiteGemsWallpaper`: Randomly selects from 142 polyhedra data files

### 3. Main Service Updates
- `ThreeDLiteExoticsWallpaper` now acts as a renderer manager
- Switches between modes based on user preferences
- Uses SharedPreferences to persist user choice

### 4. Settings UI Enhancement
- Added radio buttons for mode selection
- Real-time mode switching with toast notifications
- Defaults to Classic mode as requested

## Key Implementation Details

### SharedPreferences Constants
```java
public static final String PREFS_NAME = "ThreeDLitePrefs";
public static final String DISPLAY_MODE_KEY = "display_mode";
public static final String MODE_CLASSIC = "classic";
public static final String MODE_GEMS = "gems";
```

### Mode Switching Logic
The wallpaper service automatically detects preference changes and switches renderers without restart.

### Visual Differences
- **Classic Mode**: 9 larger, well-spaced traditional polyhedra
- **Gems Mode**: Single complex polyhedron that changes every minute

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `AbstractThreeDWallpaper.java` - Base renderer class
- `ThreeDLiteClassicWallpaper.java` - Classic mode renderer
- `ThreeDLiteGemsWallpaper.java` - Gems mode renderer

### Modified Files
- `SettingsActivity.java` - Added mode selection UI
- `ThreeDLiteExoticsWallpaper.java` - Converted to renderer manager
- Added `StockObject.java` and updated `ThreeDSolid.java` from classic version

## User Experience
1. Open the app settings
2. Select between "Classic" or "Gems" mode
3. Changes take effect immediately when wallpaper redraws
4. Setting persists across app restarts

## Default Behavior
- App defaults to **Classic mode** as requested
- No migration needed for existing users
- Settings persist in SharedPreferences

## Testing Status
✅ App builds successfully  
✅ Both modes render correctly  
✅ Mode switching works in real-time  
✅ Settings persist across restarts  
✅ Wallpaper preview shows selected mode
